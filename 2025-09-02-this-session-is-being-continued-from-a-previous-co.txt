  üèÜ The Ultimate Advanced Compound Interest Calculator - Design

  üìä Research Summary

  From analyzing the top compound interest calculators, I've identified major gaps and opportunities to create the most comprehensive calculator available online.

  Market Analysis:

  - Highest Demand: Compound interest calculators are among the most searched financial tools
  - Current Limitations: Most calculators lack advanced features like Monte Carlo simulation, inflation adjustment, and comprehensive retirement planning
  - User Needs: Investment growth visualization, retirement withdrawal strategies, tax considerations

  üéØ Advanced Feature Set Design

  1. Multiple Compound Interest Calculation Methods

  - Standard Compound Interest (A = P(1 + r/n)^nt)
  - Continuous Compounding (A = Pe^rt)
  - Effective Annual Rate calculations
  - Real vs Nominal Returns with inflation adjustment
  - Tax-Adjusted Returns for different account types

  2. Advanced Investment Scenarios

  - Regular Contributions (monthly, quarterly, annual)
  - Irregular Contributions (bonus payments, windfalls)
  - Withdrawal Planning (retirement, systematic withdrawals)
  - Goal-Based Calculations (target amount, time to goal)
  - Multiple Investment Types (401k, IRA, taxable accounts)

  3. Retirement Planning Intelligence

  - 4% Rule withdrawal strategy
  - Dynamic Withdrawal based on life expectancy
  - Monte Carlo Simulation (1000+ scenarios)
  - Sequence of Returns Risk analysis
  - Social Security Integration

  4. Advanced Data Visualization

  - Growth Timeline Chart with contributions breakdown
  - Compound Interest vs Principal visualization
  - Monte Carlo Success Probability charts
  - Inflation Impact comparison
  - Retirement Withdrawal sustainability charts

  5. Tax and Inflation Intelligence

  - Tax-Advantaged Account modeling (401k, IRA, Roth)
  - Tax Bracket considerations
  - Inflation Rate adjustments (historical averages)
  - Real Purchasing Power calculations
  - After-Tax Return analysis

  6. Professional Investment Features

  - Asset Allocation modeling
  - Rebalancing scenarios
  - Dollar-Cost Averaging analysis
  - Market Volatility impact
  - Economic Scenario planning

  Now let me implement this comprehensive calculator:

‚óè Write(app\calculator\[slug]\calculators\AdvancedCompoundInterestCalculator.tsx)
  ‚éø  Wrote 1 lines to app\calculator\[slug]\calculators\AdvancedCompoundInterestCalculator.tsx
     'use client';
     import { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from 'react';
     import {
       Calculator, RefreshCw, Info, AlertCircle, CheckCircle, Target,
       Activity, TrendingUp, User, DollarSign, PiggyBank, Zap,
       BarChart3, PieChart, LineChart, Users, Award, Clock, Percent,
       Calendar, TrendingDown, Shield, Building, Coins
     } from 'lucide-react';
     import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

‚óè I notice there's an issue with the import - let me fix that:

‚óè Update(app\calculator\[slug]\calculators\AdvancedCompoundInterestCalculator.tsx)
  ‚éø  Updated app\calculator\[slug]\calculators\AdvancedCompoundInterestCalculator.tsx with 1 addition and 1 removal
       461              <div className="flex bg-muted rounded-lg p-1 w-fit">

       463                  { key: 'basic', label: 'Basic Settings', icon: Calculator },
       464 -                { key: 'advanced', label: 'Advanced Options', icon: Settings },
       464 +                { key: 'advanced', label: 'Advanced Options', icon: Activity },
       465                  { key: 'retirement', label: 'Retirement Planning', icon: PiggyBank }
       466                ].map(({ key, label, icon: Icon }) => (
       467                  <button

‚óè Now let me create the visualization component for the compound interest calculator:

‚óè Write(components\ui\compound-interest-charts.tsx)
  ‚éø  Wrote 1 lines to components\ui\compound-interest-charts.tsx
